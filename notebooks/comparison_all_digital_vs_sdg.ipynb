      "Contrary to the known benefits fromamoderate dietary reduction during adulthood on life span and health, maternal nutrient reduction during pregnancy is supposed to affect the developing brain, probably resulting in impaired brain structure and function throughout life. Decreased fetal nutrition delivery is widespread in both developing and developed countries, caused by poverty and natural disasters, but also due to maternal dieting, teenage pregnancy, pregnancy in women over 35 years of age, placental insufficiency, or multiples. Compromised development of fetal cerebral structures was already shown in our baboon model of moderate maternal nutrient reduction. The present study was designed to follow-up and evaluate the effects of moderate maternal nutrient reduction on individual brain aging in the baboon during young adulthood (4-7 years; human equivalent 14-24 years), applying a novel, non-invasive neuroimaging aging biomarker. The study reveals premature brain aging of + 2.7 years (p < 0.01) in the female baboon exposed to fetal undernutrition. The effects of moderate maternal nutrient reduction on individual brain aging occurred in the absence of fetal growth restriction or marked maternal weight reduction at birth, which stresses the significance of early nutritional conditions in life-long developmental programming. This non-invasive MRI biomarker allows further longitudinal in vivo tracking of individual brain aging trajectories to assess the life-long effects of developmental and environmental influences in programming paradigms, aiding preventive and curative treatments on cerebral atrophy in experimental animal models and humans.\n",

      "Poor infrastructure maintenance of basic services in developing countries undermine economic development and sustainability. The process of reactive maintenance on equipment are practiced in many rural projects, resulting in a range of challenges, including high cost, shorter life expectancy of equipment and inefficient use of project engagement time by project teams. This paper proposes the use of low data rate sensors for the monitoring of rural infrastructure to assist in the practice of preventive maintenance in rural projects. The paper argues and demonstrates the importance of on-going operation and performance monitoring of infrastructure to implement preventive maintenance throughout the life cycle of rural infrastructure projects with the use of a case study-a remote village in rural South Africa. The implementation of preventive maintenance practices in rural projects show that project maintenance budgets can be utilized more efficiently when compared to traditional reactive maintenance. In addition to the reduction of maintenance cost, the implementation of preventive maintenance can lead to better life expectancy of equipment as well as safer operating and maintenance conditions for operators and maintenance teams. Findings reveal that the utilization of low data rate sensors for equipment operation and performance monitoring can support rural development as it assists preventive maintenance solutions, replacing reactive maintenance strategies. The paper further aims to assist project teams working in rural projects to improve support and maintenance of deployed infrastructure and equipment to improve the sustainability of these rural projects. The contribution of this paper is the demonstration of how the implementation of low bandwidth network technologies and sensors can be utilized for operation and performance monitoring in deep rural projects without incurring major costs to support the sustainability of these projects.\n",

      "Non-residential buildings contribute to around 20% of the total energy consumed in Europe. This consumption continues to increase globally. Smart building proposals (focused on Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB), air quality monitoring, energy saving with thermal comfort, etc.) were already necessary before 2020, and the pandemic has made this research and development area more essential. Furthermore, the need to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and obtain technological solutions based on the Internet of Things (IoT) requires holistic contributions through real installations that serve as spaces for measuring, testing, study and research. This article proposes a \"measure-analyse-decide and act\" methodology to quantify the Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI) for university buildings as a reference environment for energy efficiency and COVID-19 prevention models. Two conceptual spaces (physical and digital) within two dimensions (users and infrastructures) are designated over an IoT three-level model (information acquisition, interoperable communication, and data-driven decision). An IoT ecosystem (sensoriZAR) was implemented as a proof-of-concept of a smart campus at the University of Zaragoza, Spain. Focused on CO2 and energy consumption monitoring, the results showed effectiveness through real installations, demonstrating the IoT potential as SDG-enabling technologies. These contributions allow not only experimental lab tests (from the authors' expertise in several specialties of Industrial, Mechanical, Design, Thermal, Electrical, Electronic, Computer and Telecommunication Engineering) but also a reference model for direct application in academic works, research projects and institutional initiatives, extendable to professional environments, buildings and cities.\n",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused widespread fear and stress. The pandemic has affected everyone, everywhere, and created systemic inequities, leaving no one behind. In India alone, more than 34,094,373 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 452,454 related deaths have been reported as of October 19, 2021. Around May 2021, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases crossed the 400,000 mark, seriously hampering the health care system. Despite the devastating situation, the public response was seen through their efforts to come forward with innovative ideas for potential ways to combat the pandemic, for instance, dealing with the shortage of oxygen cylinders and hospital bed availability. With increasing COVID-19 vaccination rates since September 2021, along with the diminishing number of daily new cases, the country is conducting preventive and preparatory measures for the third wave. In this article, we propose the pivotal role of public participation and digital solutions to re-establish our society and describe how Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can support eHealth initiatives and mitigate infodemics to tackle a postpandemic situation. This viewpoint reflects that the COVID-19 pandemic has featured a need to bring together research findings across disciplines, build greater coherence within the field, and be a driving force for multi-sectoral, cross-disciplinary collaboration. The article also highlights the various needs to develop digital solutions that can be applied to pandemic situations and be reprocessed to focus on other SDGs. Promoting the use of digital health care solutions to implement preventive measures can be enhanced by public empowerment and engagement. Wearable technologies can be efficiently used for remote monitoring or home-based care for patients with chronic conditions. Furthermore, the development and implementation of informational tools can aid the improvement of well-being and dissolve panic-ridden behaviors contributing toward infodemics. Thus, a call to action for an observatory of digital health initiatives on COVID-19 is required to share the main conclusions and lessons learned in terms of resilience, crisis mitigation, and preparedness.\n",

      "Specific climate adaptation and resilience measures can be efficiently designed and implemented at regional and local levels. Climate and environmental databases are critical for achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and for efficiently planning and implementing appropriate adaptation measures. Available federated and distributed databases can serve as necessary starting points for municipalities to identify needs, prioritize resources, and allocate investments, taking into account often tight budget constraints. High-quality geospatial, climate, and environmental data are now broadly available and remote sensing data, e.g., Copernicus services, will be critical. There are forward-looking approaches to use these datasets to derive forecasts for optimizing urban planning processes for local governments. On the municipal level, however, the existing data have only been used to a limited extent. There are no adequate tools for urban planning with which remote sensing data can be merged and meaningfully combined with local data and further processed and applied in municipal planning and decision-making. Therefore, our project CoKLIMAx aims at the development of new digital products, advanced urban services, and procedures, such as the development of practical technical tools that capture different remote sensing and in-situ data sets for validation and further processing. CoKLIMAx will be used to develop a scalable toolbox for urban planning to increase climate resilience. Focus areas of the project will be water (e.g., soil sealing, stormwater drainage, retention, and flood protection), urban (micro)climate (e.g., heat islands and air flows), and vegetation (e.g., greening strategy, vegetation monitoring/vitality). To this end, new digital process structures will be embedded in local government to enable better policy decisions for the future.\n",

GIS technology can accurately locate the natural environment and geographic information surrounding the construction project. So as to make the BIM model more complete. Therefore, in the process of highway project construction, GIS data and BIM model are used to combine, so that the two can cooperate with each other to achieve the degree of complementary advantages. The two can effectively communicate and exchange data, so that the model data can be combined more accurately when modeling.

      "With the advance of multimedia and pattern recognition based medical technologies, smart medical applications in smart hospital and smart medical for individual, such as disease diagnosis and health monitoring, play an important role in our life. However, the communication infrastructure of supporting these applications is a challenge. This paper studies the energy-efficient multicast routing problem in multi-hop wireless networks for these medical applications. Energy consumption has become the main problem of sustainable development of communication networks, particularly for these applications. How to carry out high energy-efficient communication is an important research topic for wired and wireless networks to implement green communications. This paper proposes an energy-efficient multicast routing approach to multi-hop wireless networks for smart medical applications. Different from previous methods, we aim at maximizing energy efficiency of networks. To this end, we make use of topology control and sleeping mechanism to obtain the optimal routing strategy with maximum network energy efficiency to construct the network multicast route. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is effective and feasible. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",
